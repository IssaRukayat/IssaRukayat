About Me

Hi, I’m Rukayat — a Product Manager with a builder’s mindset and a soft spot for clean systems, useful products, and communities that actually help people grow.

🔭 Currently exploring workflow automation, product testing, and how to build smoother onboarding experiences.

🌱 Learning Git, GitHub, and strengthening my technical confidence as a PM who isn’t afraid to get hands-on.

👯 Open to collaborating with communities and early teams solving real problems.

🤝 I help beginners understand open source and simplify technical concepts so they’re less scary.

💬 Ask me about product workflows, testing, onboarding, automation, and anything technology-adoption related.

📫 Reach me at issarukayat4@gmail.com
 or +2348136250561.

😄 Pronouns: she/her

⚡ Fun fact: I love researching how things work, and I can spend hours reviewing user journeys for fun.

What I Actually Work With

Even though I’m a PM, I enjoy getting close to the tools that make products run.
These are the languages I explore to improve communication with engineers and support testing:

<code><img src="images/dart.png" width="65" title="Power shell" /></code>

Tools I’m Comfortable With

Here are some tools I use across testing, automation, design, and product delivery:

<code><img src="images/postman.png" width="60" title="Postman" /></code>
<code><img src="images/figma.jpeg" width="60" title="Figma" /></code>
<code><img src="images/html.jpg" width="60" title="HTML" /></code>
<code><img src="images/css.jpg" width="60" title="CSS" /></code>

I also work with tools outside the code space like ClickUp, Airtable, Zapier, Amplitude, and n8n for automation and product insights.

Small Note

This README is a work in progress just like me. As I learn more, ship more, and manage more products, I’ll keep updating it.
